# howto install

1. install raspbian with gui (LXDE or something else)

2. configure default user "pi" as autologin

3. install all necessary development tools (using apt-get install xxx)
   * libltdl-dev
   * libpopt-dev
   * libusb-dev, and/or possibly libusb++-dev and libusb-1.0-0-dev

4. download the newest version of gphoto2 and libgphoto2 (gphoto2 2.5.5 and libgphoto2 2.5.5.1 or above)
   it is strongly recommended using the newest version, because it has important bugfixed for canon cameras

5. built and install gphoto
   * enter un-tar-gzipped libgphoto2 directory.
   * ./configure, make, make install
   * after ./configure, check output for USB support. (if not present, libusb-devel or something is missing)
   * if any of the above report missing dependencies, find and install the missing bits (apt-cache search xxx, etc)
   * The same for the gphoto2 directory.
   
6. copy the folder "Scripte" to "/home/pi/Scripte"

7. copy "isoclient.desktop" to "/home/pi/.config/autostart"
   Create the autostart directory if it doesn't exist yet.
   (you should find it in the "Scripte" folder, a symbolic link to autostart will also work)
  
8. *caution dirty hack* add "chmod 777 /dev/ttyACM0" at rc.local
   [note from dave to ylf: ttyACM0 doesn't exist on my installation of PI]

9. deactivate all automounts in "pcmanFM"
10. add user pi in sudoers file for poweroff command

# using
connect your camera and arduino via usb to raspi (the usb connection can be used to supply the arduino)
boot the raspi
when the script on pi is startet, the arduino will make a reset, thats normal
after that, when everthing goes right, you should see the small ISO-Symbol left in your Fototimer Display
if a monitor is connected to raspi, debug infos are printed in the terminal window
to shutdown the raspi, there is a menu point in the submenu "special functions" from the Fototimer
